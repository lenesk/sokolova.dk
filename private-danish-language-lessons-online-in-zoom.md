## Private Danish language lessons online in Zoom

I offer private online Danish classes in Zoom for individuals and companies' employees with a flexible start date and an individually tailored curriculum. I teach Danish at all levels according to the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. 

Please, contact me by mail [elena@sokolova.dk](mailto:elena@sokolova.dk), if you would like to schedule private lessons.

Then, you will get a link to a Zoom meeting, where we can have a conversation about your needs and wishes for teaching. 

## See the prices below for individual online classes tailored to your needs:

Private students do not pay VAT; companies pay VAT of 25% added to the listed prices.

### one-to-one Zoom lessons or pre-exam training session(s) for Prøve i Dansk 3/Prøve i Dansk 2/Studieprøven (45 min.): 650 DKK

If you decide to book 5 or more lessons, the tuition is as follows:

### 5 or more x one-to-one Zoom sessions (45 min.): 3000 DKK (600 kr. per lesson)

### 10 or more x one-to-one Zoom sessions (45 min.) are priced as follows:

 * online sessions on weekdays before 17:00: 480 DKK per 45 min. 

 * online sessions on weekdays after 17:00 or anytime on Saturdays and Sundays: 550 DKK per 45 min. 

When you buy ten or more lessons, there is an option to split the payment. For example, you can divide the price in two charges. 


## Cancellations 

* The student can move the scheduled lesson to another time slot than the one agreed before the course starts only due to urgent issues or sickness; the same applies to the instructor. The lesson number is not used in that case and is transferred automatically to the next scheduled time, so no extra payment will be charged in this case for the cancelled lesson. The price of the transferred/compensation lesson(s) remains the same. The latter also applies for the transfer of the lesson(s) from a morning to an evening/weekend time slot upon agreement with the instructor. 

* Any planned or work-related cancellations/changes to the schedule of a lesson should be informed to the instructor by email or SMS the day before the online session before 10.00 p.m. 

* In cases of a late cancellation or absence by a student due to reasons other than a sudden sickness, the agreed price for the missed/not-cancelled-in-time lesson will be charged. So the lesson number in the row will be used, as if the student received teaching that day. 

* In case of a cancellation/absence by the instructor on the day of the instruction, either the full price of the lesson(s) will be paid out or the missed number of classes may be offered alternatively free of charge added to the purchased package of classes. Cases of a prooven/evident urgent disease of the instructor do not apply for compensation, and the student will not be charged for the lesson(s). The cancelled lesson(s) will be transferred automatically to the next day of the agreed schedule. 


## Other

* All the teaching materials other than the coursebook are included in the price. 

* Upon the wish of a student a free-of-charge language coaching session may be included in the course to evaluate the current progression of the
student or have a detailed conversation about the student's needs and wishes for the classes.
