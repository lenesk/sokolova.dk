# A2 Danish Online  

## Conversation topics
* Everyday life in Denmark (family forms, leisure activities and holiday opportunities, the digital citizen).
* Denmark in geography and numbers, Danish nature.
* Work and education (your education and job experience, the education system in Denmark).
* Housing types in Denmark (my housing situation, housing types & interior design).

## Focus on pronunciation
There is an ongoing focus on oral language production and pronunciation; pronunciation focus amounts to approx. 20% of teaching time, and is either an integral part of a teaching activity or a separate exercise; 
Practice in pronunciation of consonants focuses on particular sounds,  such as 'soft d'. Vowel sounds are trained with a focus on distinguishing long and short vowels and glottal stop; there will be also a focus on training syntactic or phrasal stress, rhythm, and melody; you will be introduced to assimilation and reduction.

## Fokus on listening 
Pronunciation practice will be supported through listening exercises and spelling tasks, because listening, spelling, and pronunciation go hand in hand. 
There will be listening tasks on understanding small narratives, dialogues - with the focus on spelling.  

## Grammar and syntax
The main focus of this level will be aimed at automatizing word order, including in subordinate clauses, so your language will become more elaborate and complex. You will master verbal tenses as well as usage of modal verbs in different contexts. 

## Reading and writing
You will read longer texts on given discussion topics. All the texts for reading tasks make a basis for grammar and vocabulary exercises, so developing reading speed will be supported by vocabulary extension. 
After each chapter, there will be a small written assignment, e.g., a short essay or a digtogloss. 

  
## We use a study book even for a Zoom class 
Group classes use a study book. The book's price is included in the course price. I have selected the best-structured books, with a recognizable format of lessons from chapter to chapter. You can catch up or review a new lesson on your own if you have missed a class. Your book is your offline material for doing homework and studying. I strive to integrate and adapt the best practices and methods from my teaching experience from a usual physical class into an online course. I believe that the language input should be feasible, even if you go offline, moreover, you avoid 
having hundreds of photocopies. All the materials and exercises from my online sessions will be available for a download. 

All the books I have selected for my courses have a home page. There you have free access to audio & video (including transcripts), reading, and grammar exercises.
