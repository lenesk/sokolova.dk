## Focus on pronunciation
There is an ongoing focus on oral language production and pronunciation; the pronunciation focus amounts to approx. 20% of teaching time, and is either an integral part of a teaching activity or a separate exercise; 
You will master pronunciation of consonants,  such as 'soft d'; and will learn to produce different sound variants of the same letter depending on its position in a word. Vowel sounds are trained with a focus on distinguishing long and short vowels and glottal stop; there will be also a focus on training syntactic or phrasal stress, rhythm, and melody; you will be introduced to assimilation and reduction.

## Focus on listening 
Pronunciation practice will be supported through listening exercises and spelling tasks, because listening, spelling, and pronunciation go hand in hand. There will be listening tasks on understanding small narratives, dialogues - with the focus on spelling.  

## Grammar and syntax
The main grammar focus on this level will be aimed at automatizing word order and strucuting subordinate clauses, so your language will become more elaborated and complex. You will master verbal tenses as well as usage of modal verbs in different contexts. Besides, we shall work on adjective's grammar and pronouns. 

## Reading and writing
You will read longer texts on the given discussion topics and inputs. All the texts for reading tasks make a basis for grammar and vocabulary exercises, so developing reading speed will be supported by vocabulary extension. 
After each chapter, there will be a short written assignment, e.g., a short essay or a digtogloss. 
 
## We use a study book even for a Zoom class 
Group classes use a study book. I have selected one of the best-structured books for this level, with a recognizable format of lessons from chapter to chapter. You can catch up or review a new lesson on your own if you have missed a class. Your book is your offline material for doing homework and studying. I strive to integrate and adapt the best practices and methods from my teaching experience from a usual physical class into this online course. I believe that the language input should be feasible, even if you go offline, moreover, you avoid 
having hundreds of photocopies. All the materials and exercises from my online sessions will be available for a download. 

All the books I have selected for my courses have a home page. There you have free access to audio & video (including transcripts), reading, and grammar exercises.
