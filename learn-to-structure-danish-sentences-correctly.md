# Learn to structure Danish sentences correctly - introducing my upcoming video course for self-study

## Introduction: how to approach learning sentence structure in Danish

While learning to speak Danish as a child or a teenager, one may unconsciously acquire word order structure from regular language input. When an adult learner formulates a Danish phrase, especially when the level is getting more advanced, and an adult learner wants to construct a more extended sentence, one may realize that a conscious effort is needed to master the sentence structure. 

I believe it is necessary to consciously systematize the basic principles of structuring a Danish sentence. The way I teach word order in Danish is mainly based on my learning practices, which turned out to be effective. I also apply my teaching experience of tackling a word order issue in adult learners in a short time, e.g. before an exam or as a repair of the acquired wrong sentence structure. 

Danish sentence structure is precise and allows a limited variation. Each building brick should stay at its place, and the changes in the word order may completely change the meaning of the phrase, as in the case with ‘så’ as the main clause conjunction of consequence (a) and the subclause conjunction of purpose (b).  

*Naboerne spillede høj musik, så* (therefore=result/consequence) *jeg kunne ikke sove*. = The neighbours were playing loud music, that’s why I could not sleep. 

*Naboerne spillede høj musik, så* (so that=purpose) *jeg ikke kunne sove*. = The neighbours were playing loud music (on purpose) so that I could not sleep. (They wanted me not to sleep). 

## Where do confusions in word order come from?

An intermediate and even advanced learner may have confusion in the word order. These confusions are caused by missing the distinction between the main clause and subclause in a complex sentence. Therefore it is crucial to learn how to distinguish the main clause from the subclause and structure each of the two types. 

To clarify from the beginning, the main building blocks I will operate with will be the verb and the subject. However, it’s not necessarily that a subject is a single word  - a noun or a pronoun. A whole main clause can also be a subject inside a complex sentence.

e.g. Hvor miljøvenligt økologiske fødevarer er (main clause as a subject) afhænger blandt andet af, hvordan de bliver transporteret. - How environmetaly friendly ogranic foods are depends particularly on how they are tranposrted.
 
As for the verb, I will imply the verb as the first personal verbal form in the utterance. Since often the verbal phrase may consist of 2-3 verb forms as in skulle have gjort = should have done; or vil indføre - will implement, I will from now on refer to the first personal verb form in the phrase, i.e. skulle, vil in the examples above.
