# A few words about modal adverbs in Danish
(Rendered from and inspired by *'Det er sgu da nu vist en misforståelse. Om nogle svære småord på dansk'* by *Niels Davidsen-Nielsen*, *Nyt fra Sprognævnet 1993/3*). 

*Du har jo nok hørt dem i dansk tale- og skriftsprog, ikke?* 

You have heard about modal verbs in Danish, but have you heard about modal adverbs? These are short one-syllable adverbs like *da*, *dog*, *jo*, *nok*, *nu*, *skam*, *vel* and *vist*. Sometimes they seem to work like interjections, but strictly speaking, they belong to adverbs and behave syntactically like adverbs. 

They can be both used in written and spoken language, where there is an interactional component, so they either express the attitude of the speaker or send a pragmatic/modal load in the phrase to the receiver of the utterance. So depending on who the modality is directed to or from whom it comes from, these modal adverbs can be divided into two groups: receiver-oriented and speaker-oriented (self-reflected). 

### Receiver-oriented modal adverbs 

The receiver-oriented modal adverbs  are *da*, *jo*, *nu*, *skam* and they reflect the speaker's reaction to what the speaker assumes about the receiver's understanding of the contextual load in the utterance (phrase).

> * *Jo* 

The speaker assumes, that the receiver knows and accepts what is being said, so the receiver is supposed to be knowledgeable about and the situation and accepts it. *Jo* may be translated as 'you know/you see'.

> *Selv om de er rare at have, er penge jo ikke alt her i livet*. - Even though it's nice to have money, they are not the only thing in life, you know. 

> *Det er jo ikke første gang, du har glemt dit kørekort*. – You see, it’s not the first time, you have forgotten your driving licence. 

*Jo* expresses that something is clear and is a sort of universal truth, and is usually used in affirmative sentences.
Sometimes *jo* means rather that the speaker expresses a surprise and wants to emphasize it. Still, again, the receiver will at once understand, that 'the unexpected' will be accepted, but not rejected/negated. 

> * *Det er jo min dreng, der kommer hjem - allerede*. That’s my boy, who is coming back home - already. 


> * *Da*

*Da* express disagreement of the speaker with the receiver of the information, and the speaker by saying that, tries to reassure the receiver who might be in doubt or suspicious. *Da* would express the modality of reassuring hope, so *da* may be translated as 'surely', 'of course', 'for sure, really'. 

Du har da glemt det. - I know for sure that you should know that, but maybe you have forgotten that. So da can function as a persuading adverb.   

Vi skal da have en juleaften, som vi plejer, ikke mor. - We ARE (stressed) going to celebrate Christmas, aren’t we? 
Der er da ikke noget i vejen, vel? - Everything is fine, isn’t it/right?
Kommer min mor og henter mig? .. – Ja, det gør hun da rigtignok. (a child to a caregiver in a kindergarten) - Will my mom come and take me home? - Yes, of course, 

Da may be used to show that the speaker disagrees with the receiver, and thus wants to take a distance from the situation, but still judges it. In this case it may be translated as ‘at least’, which would be close to ‘i hvert fald’. 

Du kunne da købt en lille gave til hende. - You could have at least boght her a small gift. 

Vi har da noget kage tilbage. (But at least we have some cake left)

Dog, which can also be translated as ‘however’, may also have a modal charge. Unlike jo, dog can be used in interrogative and imperative sentences, as well as exclamation utterances. 

In questions, it may express surprise or reprimand. 
Hvorfor dog det? - But why?
Kan du dog ikke høre til ende?
Hvor er det dog dejligt at se dig!

In affirmative sentences, it is often used with the verb in the past tense and expresses surprise.

Det var dog virkelig uheldigt!

Possible translations of ‘dog’
= though  Jeg ved han var der, men jeg så ham dog ikke.
= however -De bekymrede sig dog. 
= yet -Det ser ikke lovende ud, dog håber jeg stadig at det vil virke. 
= after all - Det er ikke så galt dog.
= but - Jeg hader det, men jeg gør det dog alligevel.
= still -Han er ikke en idiot, dog er han ikke så smart.
