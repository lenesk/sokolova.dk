## Why 12 weeks for A1 and A2 and two classes per week?
* It is crucial to have shorter but more frequent classes to have time between classes to assimilate the material. 
* You avoid being overwhelmed with new vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation rules per class if you have two classes.
* Every class session starts with the repetition of the previous class, and the new aspects are then introduced. 
* You thrive with the same teaching style throughout the level.
* You get socialized with the same people, rather than changing a class, say every 6 weeks. 
* All my courses have а closed admission. No current enrollment practice ensures the class's homogeneity for the sake of continuity in the curriculum. 


## Why longer classes at B1, B2, C1 once per week?
* Your language becomes more advanced and elaborated. You need to concentrate less on pronunciation drilling and require more focus on having time to speak in several rounds. 
* You practice under your teacher's supervision in a group and get immediate feedback from the teacher. 
* You need time to go through a more extended explanation or a repetition round each class. 
* It is one of the best time options for busy professionals and motivated students.
* Having a full-time job, you will be happy you have scheduled one day in your weekly calendar for the Danish course.
* Six days between the classes will give you time to accumulate material and work at your own pace.
* A class/session of 4 academic hours per day will give you plenty of opportunities to practice the language, discuss, automate vocabulary, and get personal feedback.


## We use a study book even for a Zoom class 
Group classes use a study book. The book's price is included in the course price. I have selected the best-structured books, with a recognizable format of lessons from chapter to chapter. You can catch up or review a new lesson on your own, in case you have missed a class. Your book is your offline material for doing homework and studying. I strive to integrate and adapt the best practices and methods from my teaching experience from a usual physical class into an online course. I belive that the language input should be feasible, even if you go offline, moreover, you avoid having hundreds of photocopies. All the materials and exercises from my online sessions will be available for a download. 

All the books I have selected for my courses have a home page. There you have free access to audio & video (including transcripts), reading, and grammar exercises.
