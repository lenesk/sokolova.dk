## Why 12 weeks for A1 and A2 and two classes per week?
* It is crucial to have shorter but more frequent classes to have time between classes to assimilate the material. 
* You avoid being overwhelmed with new vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation rules per class if you have two classes.
* Every class session starts with the repetition of the previous class, and the new aspects are then introduced. 
* You thrive with the same teaching style throughout the level.
* You get socialized with the same people, rather than changing a class, say every 6 weeks. 
* All my courses have closed admission - no current enrollment to ensure the homogeneity of the class, not for personal * reasons, but for the sake of continuity in the curriculum. 

## Why longer classes at B1, B2, C1 once per week?
* Your language becomes more advanced and elaborated. You need to concentrate less on pronunciation drilling and require more focus on having time to speak in several rounds. 
* You practice under your teacher's supervision in a group and get immediate feedback from the teacher. 
* You need time to go through a more extended explanation or a repetition round each class. 
* It is one of the best time options for busy professionals and motivated students.
* Having a full-time job, you will be happy you have scheduled one day in your weekly calendar for the Danish course.
* Six days between the classes will give you time to accumulate material and work at your own pace.
* A class/session of 4 academic hours per day will give you plenty of opportunities to practice the language, discuss, automate vocabulary, and get personal feedback.


### We use a study book even for a Zoom class 
To follow the course, you need to buy a study book. I have selected the most structured book, since it is an only course, so you need to have a book with a recognazable format of lessons, so that you can catch up or review it on your own. Your book is your offline residence for doing homework and reviewing. I strive to integrate the best practices and methods from a usual physical class into an online course. The langugage input should be feasible, even if you go offline. 

All the books, I have selected for my courses have a home page, where you have an unlimited and free access to audio & video (including transcripts), reading and grammrar exercies.

### Here is the list of book I build up my groupd courses upon:
