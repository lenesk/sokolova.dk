# Grammar and vocabulary tips for Writing an email Prøve i Dansk 3 (Delprøve 1)


In this blog post, you’ll learn some grammar and vocabulary tips for writing the Writing task at Prøve i Dansk 3 (Delprøve 1).

To begin with, this is a compulsory task, so it’s an excellent strategy to have some prepared and memorized structures ready for the exam. To succeed in writing the task, I advise you to understand the assessment criteria and what you are expected to write. 

Email writing is the task where your writing skills for informal writing are assessed. It does not mean, that you write as casual as on Facebook and any chat thread, but if you think of the settings, then choose a friendly, engaged in the communication tone with elements of discussing an issue related to the receiver. 

The focus of the email task is to answer the questions in the task email. That would imply such speech acts as description, narration (elements of storytelling), suggestion, explanation and giving comments. Here below is a screenshot from the guidelines for PD3. There the task is described in terms of the focus aspects in it. These focus parts make the ground for the assessment criteria, not to mention the high level of general literacy and correct language use.

## Make sure you have understood the original task mail

Read the whole original email of the task and make sure, you have understood all the words and the situation. It will be a fiasco to realize after the exam, you have misunderstood the email and wrote something irrelevant. Look up new words, if needed. 
Count how many questions there are in the task email. They all are underlined. In the example from the exam paper above you have to answer the following questions: 
Tror du, du kommer til at savne skolen?
Har du nogen idéer til, hvad vi kan gøre, så Laszlo hurtigere lærer dansk?
Hvad gjorde du egentlig for at få nogle danske venner?
Og så glæder jeg mig til at ses næste weekend. Hvad synes du, vi skal lave?

## Help your brain to think about one problem at a time

Write down your ideas in keywords for each question. It will help you to focus your attention on accuracy and grammar when you will start writing. In other words, your exam stressed brain will have to multitask less. It’s a known fact that when you make up the sentence and think about what to write, it seems for necessary that making a correct word order. But you will free your mind of this ‘what-to-write-about’ load if you put down key words before formulating full sentences. 

## How to write the greeting
It’s essential to keep the focus on what you are asked about in the task email, which you are writing an answer to. Anyway, any email should start with an informal greeting. 
Never put a comma after the person you greet, unlike in English. An exclamations mark may be used, but some people consider it too emotional or old-fashioned.
