## Schedule for the courses available for sign up in July-November 2020

If you have questions while signing up online for the course, e.g., if you are in doubt what level to choose, do not hesitate to write me directly by mail, [elena@sokolova.dk](mailto:elena@sokolova.dk). 

We can always discuss your needs and preferences even though you sign up for a group class. It would be helpful for me to know your previous background in studying Danish to help you choose the writing level.
