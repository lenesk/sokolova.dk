### Admission requirements
This course is for those who have acquired Danish level B2 or passed Prøve i Dansk 3. It is not a prerequisite to pass Prøve i Dansk 3, but you should be confident at Danish level B2, especially in writing.

Please, contact me by mail [elena@sokolova.dk](mailto:elena@sokolova.dk), if you have questions about the course or would know more about the sign up.  

After the course has started, no running enrollment is possible to ensure the homogeneity of the class. 
Should you change your mind after the first class, you have an unconditional money-back guarantee of the total course price. 

### Four reasons to take a training course running right up to the exam:

* you get ready for the exam in a smaller group class (8-10 students);
* prep curriculum is stretched over 11 sessions for efficient assimilation of material;
* access to preparing materials;
* well-structured lessons with a focus on all the aspects of the exam content. 


### Why choose a once-per-week course? 

* Best time option for busy professionals and motivated students. 

* From my teaching experience and from the feedback, I got from my students, I can say that it is most efficient to do a Studieprøve course when you can spread the homework, e.g., writing an essay or watching a tv-program another day over more than two days. You can plan and manage your time from class to class and probably even review your training essay twice. 

* If you are thinking of doing the class, having a full-time job, you will be happy you have scheduled one day in your weekly calendar for the Danish course. 

* Having six days between the classes would give you time to accumulate material and work at your own pace.

* An online class/session of 3 academic hours per day in a small group will give you plenty of opportunities to practice the language, discuss, automate vocabulary, and get personal feedback.  


### Why 11 sessions?

It takes time to get ready to Studieprøven, to understand the structure of the exam, and try writing an essay one step at a time. Think that you had to write an academic essay about genetically modified foods or analyze statistics about the education policy in Denmark? Think of the length of the exam - 3 hours for Writing the essay part of the written exam and the Reading part of 1,5 hours. Hence, you need time to practice the language and accumulate vocabulary to develop reading, writing, and speaking skills in academic Danish (C1). You have probably been learning English for years to master a language, so the time matters. 

--------------------------------------------

### The focus of the course
 
* The course covers several broader topics that lay the foundation for the content of the exam materials. 
* You will receive personal feedback on the Writing part of the exam (Skriftlig fremstilling).
* You will regularly practice doing Reading tasks from previous years’ exam sheets. 
* You will learn how to structure your presentation for the oral exam based on the official assessment criteria. 
* You will learn how to manage your time during the exam and try to complete all the mock exam tasks in the exam time limits.  

The course has a focus on building a substantial vocabulary at C1 level and practicing pragmatic skills in Danish, needed to pass the exam. You will do much more than just discussing the answers to exam sets. You will work with various language inputs (latest newspaper articles, tv-programs, podcasts, topic-related texts for High School natives), functional grammar, and syntax. All the study materials have a focus on preparing you to Studieprøven. All the study materials are provided free of charge.

### What is Studieprøven? 

Studieprøven is the Higher Education Examination and the last level on Danish Language 3, Module 6. It is the most advanced test of the Danish Language System. You can use the results of Studieprøven to apply for admission to a higher education program in Denmark. 
You can find samples of exam sets from last year here to assess the level of complexity: https://uim.dk/arbejdsomrader/danskundervisning-og-prover-for-udlaendinge/prover/danskprover/eksempler-pa-tidligere-afholdte-prover
