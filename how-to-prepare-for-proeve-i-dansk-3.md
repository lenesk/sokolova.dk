Dear learner of Danish!

Thank you in advance for your interest in my guide 'How to prepare to Pr√∏ve i Dansk 3'.  

The guide contains useful links for study materials, as well as description of the assessment criteria, samples of exam papers, and of course tips on how to prepare each task.


Best regards,

Elena

The first version of the guide was issued on August 7th, 2022. 

In January 2023, I have uploaded an updated version of the guide.
