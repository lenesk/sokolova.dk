# Participle in Danish in the adjective function

*Elena Sokolova, September 8 <sup>th</sup> 2021*

I am pretty sure you have sometimes doubted the endings in words like stresset/stressende; vokset/voksende, since such 'pairs' are occasionally confusing and look similar. In this blog post, you can learn about 'adjectives' that resemble verbs but are not verbs by their pure definition.
 
## Present participle (in Danish called præsens participium/langt participium)
 
Present participle in Danish is often used in the adjective function to describe an activity-related quality inherent to an object, person or phenomenon. The idea of activity-related quality is derived from the verb. Thus, the present participle describes what an object, person or phenomenon is actively doing, not through a 'normal' verb, but a 'verbal adjective'. The present participle is formed by adding *-(e)nde* to the infinitive, i.e. to the verbs initial dictionary form. If the infinitive of the verb already ends in -e (as the majority of Danish verbs do), the just *-nde* is added.
 
Remember:
 
The present participle behaves like an adjective but never undergoes t-matching with the gender of the noun, e.g. 

> *et krævende job* = a demanding job (from *kræve* - to demand; no t-matching is needed with an 'et-noun'). 
 
It does not have the e-ending, unlike 'pure' adjectives for describing a plural noun/definite noun (after triggers like *den/det/de*/possessive words). It seems natural since it has already '-e', and phonetic combinability does not allow an extra -e.
 
See some examples:
 
> * *at stige* = to increase => *stige* (infinitive) + *-nde* => *stigende* = increasing 
> * *en stigende arbejdsløshed* = an increasing unemployment
> * *landets stigende arbejdsløshed* = the country's increasing unemployment
> * *jeres stigende interesse* = your increasing interest
> * *de stigende priser* = the increasing prices
> * *til en stigende pris* = for an increasing price <br>

 
> * *at vokse* = to grow => + *-nde* => *voksende* = growing
> * *en voksende ulighed* = a growing inequality; 
> * *den voksende ulighed i samfundet* = the increasing inequality in the society;
> * *voksende smittetal* (pl. et tal, mange tal) = growing infection rates

 
## Past participle (Præteritum participium/kort participium)
 
Past participle in Danish is often used as an adjective to describe a passive activity-related quality/state inherent to an object, person or phenomenon. The idea of quality is derived from the verb. The past participle describes what a thing, person or phenomenon is/was exposed to passively, not through an ordinary verb in the passive voice, but a 'verbal adjective' of a passive meaning. It is therefore often called 'static/state passive'. The past participle is formed by using the third form of the verb, the same, e.g. is used to create førnutid and førdatid. 
 
See some examples:
 
> *at afvise* (conjugation: *afviste*-*afvist*) = to reject => *et afvist forslag* = a rejected suggestion <br>
 
> *at diskutere* (conjugation: *diskuterede* - *diskuteret*) = to discuss => et diskuteret spørgsmål = a discussed question <br>
 
> *at forbyde* (conjugation: *forbød* - *forbudt*) = to prohibit => *en forbudt medicin* = *a banned medicine* <br>

 
Unlike present participle, the past participle may undergo some changes, just like adjectives. 
Remember that the present participle never undergoes t-matching with the gender of the noun. 
 
However, past participles of the verbs undergo the e-adding when there is a necessary trigger (for describing a plural noun/definite noun & after triggers like *den/det/de*/possessive words). 
 
See some examples:
 
> * *at indføre* (conjugation: *indførte* - *indført*) = to implement 

> * *den indførte brugerbetaling i sundhedsvæsenet* = the implemented healthcare fee 
E-adding here is necessary, since *brugerbetaling* is definite with the participle in front of it. 
 
While adding the e-ending to the past participle, spelling changes may occur if the verb's past participle form ends en *-et*. 
After the e-adding *-et* it will change to *-ede*.

> * *et diskuteret emne* = a disucussed topic
> * *ét af de mest omdiskuterede emner i valgdebatten* - one of the most discussed topics in the election debate (e-adding in 'diskuteret' for plural matching & defitine form of the noun; + changing of -et to -ede) <br>

> * *en strikket trøje* = a knitted shirt
> * *min strikkede trøje* = my knitted shirt (e-adding after a possive trigger) 
 
 
## Guess why e- in *malede* - is it a verb in the past simple tense (datid)?
 
> a) *Alle væggene i huset blev malet*. = All the walls in the house were painted. 
Focus on the activity, i.e. someone has come and painted the walls; i.e. traditional passive voice.
 
> b) *Alle væggene i huset var malede*. = All the walls in the house were painted. 
Focus on the quality of the walls and how they looked like, i.e. they were not worn out and looked freshly painted.
