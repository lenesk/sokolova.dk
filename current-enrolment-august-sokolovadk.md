# Learn Danish online

After ten years of teaching Danish to foreigners in langugae schools, I have now opened enrollment to online group courses starting in August in my private language studio [SokolovaDK](https://sokolova.dk/online-group-classes-levels-and-schedule). You can find more information about courses and study materials at [sokolova.dk](https://sokolova.dk/current-courses-for-sign-up). 

You can sign up and pay directly on my homepage. Sign up deadline for A1, A2, B1.1 is August 1st. Sign up deadline for C1 is August 17th.

If you have questions while signing up online for the course, e.g., if you are in doubt what level to choose, do not hesitate to write me directly by mail, [elena@sokolova.dk](mailto:elena@sokolova.dk). We can always discuss your needs and preferences, it would be also helpful for me to know your previous background in studying Danish to help you choose the writing level.
