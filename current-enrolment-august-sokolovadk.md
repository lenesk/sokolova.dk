# Learn Danish online

I have been teaching Danish at alle levels to foreigners in langugae schools in Copenhagen for eight years. 
In July 2020, I established my own language studio [SokolovaDK](https://sokolova.dk/online-group-classes-levels-and-schedule). 
I offer online Danish courses to groupds and individuals.
