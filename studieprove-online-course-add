Why choose a once-per-week course? 
Best time option for busy professionals and motivated students

From my teaching experience and from the feedback I got from my students, I can say that it is most efficient to do a Studieprøve course when you can spread the homework e.g., writing an essay or watching a tv-program another day over more than 2 days. 
You can plan and manage your time from class to class and probably even review your essay twice. 

It takes time to get ready to Studieprøven, to understand the structure of the exam, and try writing an essay one step at a time. If you are thinking of doing the class, having a full-time job, you will be happy you have scheduled one day in your calendar for the Danish course per week. 

Having six days between the classes would give you time to accumulate material and work at your own pace.

A class/session of 4 academic hours will give you plenty of opportunities to practice the language, discuss, automate vocabulary, and get personal feedback.  

Why 11 sessions? 
Think that you had to get ready to write an academic essay about genetically modified foods or analyze statistics about the education policy in Denmark? Think of the length of the exam - 3 hours for Writing the essay part of the written exam and the Reading of 1,5 hours. Hence, you need time to practice the language and accumulate vocabulary to develop reading, writing, and speaking skills in academic Danish (C1). You have probably been learning English for years to master a language, so time matters.

The focus of the course
 
My Studieprøven online course in Zoom covers several broader topics that lay the foundation for the content of the exam materials. You will receive personal feedback on the Writing part of the exam (Skriftlig fremstilling) and will regularly practice doing Reading tasks from previous years’ exam sheets. You will learn how to structure your presentation for the oral exam based on the official assessment criteria. 

The course has a focus on building a substantial vocabulary at C1 level and practicing pragmatic skills in Danish, needed to pass the exam. You will do much more than just discussing the answers to exam sets. You will work with various language inputs (latest newspaper articles, tv-programs, podcasts, topic-related texts for High Schools natives), functional grammar, and syntax. All the study materials have a focus on preparing you to Studieprøven.

What is Studieprøven? 

Studieprøven is the Higher Education Examination and the last level on Danish Language 3, Module 6. It is the most advanced test of the Danish Language System. You can use the results of Studieprøven to apply for admission to a higher education program in Denmark. 
You can find samples of exam sets from last year here to assess the level of complexity: https://uim.dk/arbejdsomrader/danskundervisning-og-prover-for-udlaendinge/prover/danskprover/eksempler-pa-tidligere-afholdte-prover
