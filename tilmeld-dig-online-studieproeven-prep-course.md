### Admission requirements
This course is for those who have acquired Danish level B2 or passed Prøve i Dansk 3. 
It is not a prerequisite to pass Prøve i Dansk 3, but you should be confident at Danish level B2, especially in writing.

Please, contact me by mail [elena@sokolova.dk](mailto:elena@sokolova.dk), if you have questions about the course or would know more about the sign up.  

After the course has started, no running enrollment is possible to ensure the homogeneity of the class. 
Should you change your mind after the first class, you have an unconditional money-back guarantee of the total course price. 

### Four reasons to take a training course running right up to the exam:

* you get ready for the exam in a smaller group class (8-10 students);
* access to preparing materials;
* well-structured lessons with a focus on all the aspects of the exam content. 

### The focus of the course
 
* The course covers several broader topics that lay the foundation for the content of the exam materials. 
* You will receive personal feedback on the Writing part of the exam (Skriftlig fremstilling).
* You will practice doing Reading tasks from previous years’ exam sheets. 
* You will learn how to structure your presentation for the oral exam based on the official assessment criteria. 
* You will learn how to manage your time during the exam and try to complete all the mock exam tasks in the exam time limits.

### What is Studieprøven? 

Studieprøven is the Higher Education Examination and the last level on Danish Language 3, Module 6. It is the most advanced test of the Danish Language System. You can use the results of Studieprøven to apply for admission to a higher education program in Denmark. 
You can find samples of exam sets from last year here to assess the level of complexity: https://uim.dk/arbejdsomrader/danskundervisning-og-prover-for-udlaendinge/prover/danskprover/eksempler-pa-tidligere-afholdte-prover
