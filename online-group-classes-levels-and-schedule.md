### B2 courses can be taken in any order.

### The course price does not include the price for the study book, and you need to order a book on your own.

## Why 10 weeks for A1 and A2 and two classes per week?
* It is crucial to have shorter but more frequent classes to have time between classes to assimilate the material. 
* You avoid being overwhelmed with new vocabulary, grammar, and pronunciation rules per class if you have two classes.
* Every class session starts with the repetition of the previous class, and the new aspects are then introduced. 
* You thrive with the same teaching style throughout the level.
* You get socialized with the same people, rather than changing a class, say every 6 weeks. 
* All my courses have а closed admission. No current enrollment practice ensures the class's homogeneity for the sake of continuity in the curriculum. 


# [Online group classes starting in August/September 2020](current-courses-for-sign-up)

If you have questions while signing up online for the course, e.g., if you are in doubt what level to choose, do not hesitate to write me directly by mail, [elena@sokolova.dk](mailto:elena@sokolova.dk). We can always discuss your needs and preferences, it would be also helpful for me to know your previous background in studying Danish to help you choose the writing level. 

## We use a study book even for a Zoom class 
Group classes use a study book. The book's price is included in the course price. I have selected the best-structured books, with a recognizable format of lessons from chapter to chapter. You can catch up or review a new lesson on your own, in case you have missed a class. Your book is your offline material for doing homework and studying. I strive to integrate and adapt the best practices and methods from my teaching experience from a usual physical class into an online course. I belive that the language input should be feasible, even if you go offline, moreover, you avoid having hundreds of photocopies. All the materials and exercises from my online sessions will be available for a download. 

All the books I have selected for my courses have a home page. There you have free access to audio & video (including transcripts), reading, and grammar exercises.
