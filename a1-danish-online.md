## Zoom required to be installed on your device

You will get instructions about Zoom install before the course start. You do not need to get a paid version of Zoom, but will be invited to join live session with me as a host. Video and chat materials are not saved on the Zoom server upon the end of each video session. 

## We use a study book even for a Zoom class 
Group classes use a study book. I have selected one of the best-structured books for this level, with a recognizable format of lessons from chapter to chapter. You can catch up or review a new lesson on your own if you have missed a class. Your book is your offline material for doing homework and studying. I strive to integrate and adapt the best practices and methods from my teaching experience from a usual physical class into this online course. I believe that the language input should be feasible, even if you go offline, moreover, you avoid 
having hundreds of photocopies. All the materials and exercises from my online sessions will be available for a download. 

All the books I have selected for my courses have a home page. There you have free access to audio & video (including transcripts), reading, and grammar exercises.
