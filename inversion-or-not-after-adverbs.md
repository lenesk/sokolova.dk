# Inversion or not - how free and central adverbs may guide you to correct word order in a Danish sentence.

* How to distinguish between central or free adverbs in Danish, and how do they affect the sentence structure? 
* Which adverbs trigger inversion and which seldom work as inversion triggers? 
* Why are there so many inversion cases, which I do not understand? 
* How to place the adverb correctly in a sentence? 

These are probably the questions you have asked yourself while doing a written assignment or even preparing for the exam's reading part. This blog post will help you feel less annoyed while structuring the Danish phrase (I know it can be even frustrating). You will learn specific rules about treating adverbs properly because they deserve your attention. They serve to express a lot of what you want to say, e.g. your attitude to things,  and make it easier for a listener to understand your intention. Moreover, the adverbs are the markers you can use during your exam to indicate that you are explaining, assessing, reasoning, giving arguments for and/or against. They also help the examiner assess your presentation or a  writing task according to the assessment criteri. 

## Adverbs are an optional field in the sentence

You have undoubtedly heard about inversion in Danish when the verb comes before the subject in the main clause. The inversion of the verb is a phenomenon that happens in the main clause. The main clause (called *hovedsætning* in Danish) is a logically complete and independent utterance/phrase (even a one-word utterance), which can be ended with a full stop without confusing the recipient in terms of the pragmatical goal. In most cases - unless it is dialogue - as a minimum, it consists of a subject (a doing person/thing/phenomenon/formal subject/notion of activity) and a verb (activity phrase/action word). Adverbs are an optional field. They are not usually the core of the sentence, unless a sentence consists of one adverb only in spoken language, for example, *Måske./Selvfølgelig*, again in a dialogue for example. 

> *Coronanedlukningen ændrede* (*pludselig* = suddenly, an adverb of manner) *vores hverdag sidste år*. = Corona lockdown changed suddenly our day flow.

In this example, *pludselig* is an adverb in the main clause. 

## What is an adverb?

An adverb is a word or an expression that describes a verb, adjective, another adverb, a whole clause, even a preposition, or sentence. Adverbs can describe manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as *hvordan?*, *på hvilken måde?*, *hvornår?*, *hvor?*, and *i hvor høj grad?*. They may be single words  (*måske, derfor, nemlig, effektivt*) or multi-word adverbial phrases like *under alle omstændigheder* (=under all circumstances), *på den måde* (=in that way), *på vej til arbejde* (=on the way to work), *ved at indføre nye regler* (=by introducing new rules); *på den ene side* - *på den anden side* (on the one-other hand).

Often they extend the verb giving details about modality (a speakers' attitude to the sentence), e.g. degree of certanty (*desværre, ikke, næppe, gerne*), time (*bagefter, sommetider*), place (*hertil, deroppe*), logical relations (consequense: *derfor; reasoning: *nemlig*); pure manner of action (*hurtigt, effektivt, pludselig*). 

### Free and central adverbs in the main clause: Scenario 1.
In the Danish sentence, we should distinguish between free and central adverbs. There can be two scenarios of the word order in the main clause where the adverbs are optional fields. If we take adverbs out, the supplementary meaning will be affected, but the core of the sentence will remain the same. So how do we place the adverbs in the main clause? Let's analyse two possible scenarios.

#### Scenario 1: starting with a subject + verb1+ optional field 

> *Anne* (subject/doing person/thing) *drikker* (verb1) *altid* (adverb) *grøn te* (object) *hver morgen* (adverb of time). = Anne always drinks green tea every morning. 

This optional field right after the verb can be often immediately filled with an object (grøn te) or an adverb.

> *Alex* (subject) *er* (verb 1) *også/altid/ikke/aldrig/sommetider/nogle gange/derfor* (adverb) *glad* for sine arbejdsopgaver.

or 

> *Anna* (subject) *elsker* (verb 1) *selvfølgelig* (adverb) *at drikke* (verb 2) *grøn te* (object) *om morgenen* (free adverbs).

Both free and central adverbs can fill the place of the optional field right of the verb in the formula according to Scenario 1 of the main clause: Subject+Verb1 + optional field. What is special about the central adverbs is that they in scenario 1 only come after the verb 1, while free adverbs may also come later in the sentence. So it is important to know which adverbs are central and come right after the verb 1, and which are free adverbs and more free citizens in the sentence, but often also choose the residence right after the verb 1. 

### Gategories of central adverbs:

* adverbs of time: *altid* (never), *aldrig* (never), *tit/ofte* (often), *snart* (soon), *straks* (immediately/at once), *lige* (just/like in ‘just now’/'shortly', or 'very recently' or 'in a moment'), *allerede* (already), *sjældent* (seldom, rarely), *stadig*, *stadigvæk* (=still), *længe* (for a long time), *nogensinde* (ever); 

* modal adverbs like *da* (indeed), *vel* (a tag 'right?'), *nok* (for sure), *vist* (obviously), *jo* (=as you know);

* adverbs of degree/certainty/attitude to the sentnce, fx *simpelthen* (simply/just), *virkelig* (really), *vel nok* (definitely), *sagtens* (easily/sure), *godt-gerne* (of course), *kun* (only), *sikkert* (definitely), *ikke* (not);

* adverbs which in the context refer to the previous sentence/phrase: *også*, *heller ikke* (also not), *gerne* (willingly), *nemlig* (actually/exactly/for that reason). 

> *Der er sikkert* (central adverb) *mange argumenter for og imod de nye regler for barsel*. = There are definitely many arguments for and against new rules for parental leave. 

> *Mange studerende har ofte* (central adverb) *udfordringer med at klare sig økonomisk*. = Many students have often challenges in making two end meet. 

It is easy to conclude that all the other adverbs, which are not central, are free. So learn the list of central adverbs, and you will be safe. If you know, you dead with the central adverbs, do not start a sentence with them. 

### 3.3. Central adverbs vs. free adverbs 

> * Anne* (subject/doing person/thing) *elsker* (verb1) *altid* (central adverb)/*selvfølgelig*(free adverbs) *at drikke* (verb 2) *grøn te* (obejct) *hver morgen/alene/selvfølgelig* (free adverbs, which comes after the optional field). 

As you can see, free adverbs in scenario 1 one may be placed:

* in the optional field after the verb 1 just like central advers (and before the object unless it is an unstressed pronoun: *Jeg hygger mig altid med mine venner i weekenden*: *mig* here breaks into the formula, because it is weak and unstressed and needs shelter even before the adverb right after the verb 1 which is stressed and gives protection). The same is in the example *Jeg ved det ikke*, where *det* is an unstressed pronoun.
> *Et relevant studiejob har selvfølgelig* (free adverb in the central place in the optional field) *en positiv betydning for ens fremtidige karriere*.

* in the optional field later in the sentence (after the object), while cental adverbs in scenario 1, may not be placed later in the sentence. 

> *Man skal derfor* (free adverb in the central place) *tænke på at finde et studierelevant job tidligt* (free adverb) *under uddannelsen*.
 

## 4. Free and central adverbs in the main clause: Scenario 2 with inversion: 

Imagine starting your main sentence not with the subject, but something else, which can be called an INVERSION TRIGGER. Then the sentence will have the following scenario:  

INVERSION TRIGGER+ Verb1 + Subject + optional field (cenrtal or free Adverb) + (optional Verb2)+ object

e.g. For at få en permanent opholdstilladelse i Danmark (inversion trigger: adverbal phrase of condition/purpose) skal (Verb1) man (subject) først (free adverb) bo (verb 2) i landet (free adverb) i nogle år (free adverb). = In order to get a permanent residence permit in Denmark, one should live in the country for some years. 

As we are not robots, we may need or wish to start a sentence with something other than a subject, and this usually triggers inversion - the verb comes before the subject. Inversions happen only in the main clause and depend on the verb's immediate surroundings. 

#### There are two conditions for inversion to happen: 
* a) it should be the main clause;
* b) there should be an inversion trigger at the beginning of this main clause. 

#### 4.2.Free adverbs are inversion triggers.

Remember that free adverbs or adverbial phrases, e.g. time, sequence, result, consequence, attitude, opposition, are common triggers of inversion. The list is very long, but when you know the list of central adverbs, you can safely refer a new adverb you come across to the category of free adverbs. 

e.g. /måske/selvfølgelig/for eksempel/derfor/til gengæld (=on the contrary & in compensation for smth)/bagefter/på den måde (=in that why/therefore)/på den ene side/på den anden side/derimod (on the contrary/however); dog (however); tværtimod (even on the contrary);  

Look up in the Danish-Danish dictionary, if you are in doubt, whether you deal with an adverb. Especially if you have come across a new word. https://ordnet.dk/ddo/ordbog?query=derimod&tab=for

Examples: 
1) Selvfølgelig (Free adverb as an inversion triggre => choose Scenation 2)) har Jens også (også =central adverb in the optional field)/heldigvis (free adverb) mange gode venner i København. = Of course Jens have fortunately many good friends in Copenhagen. 
So the formula here is 
Free adverb+ Verb1+subject+central adverb/another free adverb+ obeject

2) Folkeskoler tilbyder gratis undervising. Til gengæld (free adverb 'on the contrary'/while) har private skoler færre elever i klassen. = Municipal secondary schools offer free education, on the contrary, private schools have fewer pupils in a class. 

So the formula of the second sentence here is 
Free adverb+ Verb1+subject+ object

3)På den ene side (free adverb) er V det S en fordel, at man selv kan bestemme over sine arbejdstider, på den anden side (free adverb) er der risiko for, at grænsen mellem arbejde og privatliv flyder sammen. = On the one hand it is an advantage, that you can determine your working ours, on the other hand there is a risk that the borders between private life and work will fade. 

4) Dermed (free adverb =with that) kommer der flere udfordringer i forhold til ansættelsesaftaler. = Consequently there come more challenges with eplyoment contracts. 

5) Dog (However) er jeg ikke enig i, at forbud mod biler i centrum kan løse trafikproblemer i store byer.  = However, I do not agrre on that a ban on cars in the city center can solve the traffic problems. 

## 5. Mini exercise: try rephrasing these sentences so that the free adverbs, inversion triggers, stay as central adverbs in the main clause. In that case, there will not be an inversion in the main clause.
e.g. 
4) Der (subject) kommer (verb1) dermed (free adverb =with that) flere udfordringer i forhold til ansættelsesaftaler. = Consequently there come more challenges with eplyoment contracts. 

## 6. Adverbs in the dependent clause

### 6.1 What is the dependent clause?
The dependent clause/subordinate clause (called ledsætning in Danish) is a logically incomplete and dependent utterance/phrase, which is often not enough to reach the pragmatical goal of the speaker. A subclause works as a supplement to the main clause, often adding or extending the content/pragmatics of the main clause. The main and subclause are logically connected. For exmaple, the main clause may contain information that is only true on the condition that the subordinate clause is true, as is the case with (if-sentences).

e.g. Jeg kan fortsætte med at arbejde i samme firma (main clause), hvis (=if conditional conjunction intruducing a subclause=>) jeg (subject) heldigvis (free adverb = fortunately)/også (central) kan få forlænget (get extended) min kontrakt (LS). 


### 6.2 How to detect the subclause?

There are two ways to do that. 
* 1) The subclause can be detected by spotting the subclause conjunction (it's a separate topic, but you probably know them like når/da/fordi/mens/hvis). A conjunction is a function word that shows the logical relationship between the main and subclause. 
* 2) However, sometimes, especially in spoken language, conjunctions can be omitted (like som, at). In this case, you can ask a logical question from the main clause to a subclause. 

> *Han siger (main clause=>what does he say?=> the answer is in the subclause), at (that-an optional conjuction of additional info) han (subject) også/altid/ikke/aldrig/sommetider/nogle gange (free or central adverb) er træt af sine arbejdsopgaver. 

The conjunction at can be omitted in spoken and written language, so you can say a question: He says 'what'? => then a subclause comes and extends what he says. So it is dependent on Han siger.  

Remember the subclause has only one scenario for word order: 
* always start with the subject, 
* then add an adverb (which is optional, if needed by the meaning of the sentence and both central and free adverbs are possible) 
* and then put the verb1 (or if required verb 2, verb 3).

The word order of the subclause never changes, no matter whether the subclause comes after or before the main clause. It may only have inversion when it is integrated inside the main clause, but it happens seldom. The word order of the subclause is almost frozen. Some learners feel it sounds wrong to say 'fordi jeg gerne vil hjælpe dig', but it means that these learners have automatized the word order of the main clause = Jeg vil gerne/godt hjælpe dig, and they automatically place the words in the subclause as according to the main clause rule (scenario 1). 

Turn main clauses into subclauses and see what will happen. 

Jeg er kun delvist enig i, at det er effektivt at indføre øremærket barsel. =>
Peter siger, at han kun delvist er enig i, at det er effektivt at indføre barsel. 

Besparelser i sundhedsvæsenet kan derfor øge risiko for, at nogle patienter ikke får behandling i tide. => Jeg er enig i, at besparelser i sundhedsvæsenet derfor kan øge risiko for, at nogle patienter ikke får behandling i tide. 

### 6.3. Preserve or insert an conjucntion into subclause to place the adverb correctly
Han siger (main clause), at (that-an optional conjuction of additional info) han (subject) også/altid/ikke/aldrig/sommetider/nogle gange (free or central adverb) er træt af sine arbejdsopgaver. 
At can be omitted, so you can say a question He says what? => the

Jeg har et krævende(=demanding) arbejde [main clause], som (conjunction=which) jeg (subject) nogle gange (free adverb) også (free adverb) kan være (=be) stresset af. 

If som is omitted, you may place nogle gange & også wrong, so make sure you have checked, whether you deal with a main or subclause. 

1 a) Det er den mest spændende film, jeg nogensinde har set.

1 b) Det er den mest spændende film, som jeg nogensinde har set.

The trick about finding a subclause is sometimes that, you have to add the missing conjunction, and it is very important to do it to make sure that you deal with the subclause. 

Adverbs never stand at the beginning of a subclause
n a subclause comes. 

Jeg har et krævende(=demanding) arbejde [main clause], som (conjunction=which) jeg (subject) nogle gange (free adverb) også (free adverb) kan være (=be) stresset af. 

If som is omitted, you may place nogle gange & også wrong, 

Jeg kan fortsætte (continue) med at arbejde i samme firma (main clause), hvis (=if, konj.) jeg (S) heldigvis (free adverb = fortunately) kan få forlænget (get extended) min kontrakt (LS). 

1 a) Det er den mest spændende film, jeg nogensinde har set.

1 b) Det er den mest spændende film, som jeg nogensinde har set.

The trick about finding a subclause is sometimes that you have to add the missing conjuction, and it is very important to do it in order to make sure that you deal with the subclause. 


Turn main clauses into subclauses and see what will happen. 

Jeg er kun delvist enig i, at det er effektivt at indføre øremærket barsel. =>
