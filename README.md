## About me

<img src="elena-sokolova.jpg" style="float:right" width="300" height="300" />

I moved to Denmark in 2010 to do my Master's Degree in Linguistics at Aarhus University after living five years in Moscow, where I had studied Translation, Interpreting, and Linguistics majoring in English and Danish. During the last ten years, I have been teaching Danish as a second and foreign language in Denmark, mostly in Copenhagen. I have experience in teaching Danish at all levels (online in Zoom, blended courses, regular classroom groups, as well as I give individual lessons). I have been tutoring students, preparing for the Danish language B2 and C1 exams (Prøve i Dansk 3 og Studieprøven). 

I have always been interested in bilingualism as a socio-linguistic phenomenon, so I have chosen a bilingual track in my life. To learn a new language, you need to build a language personality over time, and then you'll start feeling this language. But nothing comes from nothing, so personal efforts and essential guidance and scaffold should support you in learning a new language. Various neurological studies show that adults do not learn a new language as children. I believe that adults can master a foreign language and become near-native users of this language through conscious learning, living into the language, and using it actively.
