I moved to Denmark in 2010 to do my Master's in Linguistics at Aarhus University. Before, I lived in Moscow, where I majored in Translation, Interpreting, and Linguistics. During the last ten years, I have been teaching Danish to foreigners. I have experience in teaching Danish at all levels (online in Zoom, blended courses, regular classroom groups and one-to-one). I have been tutoring students, preparing for the Danish language exams on levels B2 & C1 (Prøve i Dansk 3 & Studieprøven). 

I have always been interested in bilingualism, so I have chosen a bilingual track in my life. To learn a new language, you need to build a language personality over time, and then you'll start feeling this language. But nothing comes from nothing, so personal efforts and essential guidance and scaffold should support you in learning a new language. I believe that adults can master a foreign language and become near-native users of this language through conscious learning, living into the language, and using it actively.
